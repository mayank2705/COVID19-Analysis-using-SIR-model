# COVID19-Analysis-using-SIR-model
I have done an analysis and data modelling of Covid-19 disease cases in India and Italy using a compartmental model named SIR model.
This model comprises of three parameters- Suspicious, Infectious and Recovered. These parameters show the no of people who are suspicious, infected and recovered in particular country or in whole world.

There are a lot of data which is available on internet. Here I have used mostly used dataset from the John Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The links for the datasets are:
* [time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
* [time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv)
* [time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv)  ...
I have made proper graphs to demonstrate the statistics of the no of cases in whole world and some countries as well.
