# COVID19-Analysis-using-SIR-model
I have done an analysis and data modelling of Covid-19 disease cases in India and Italy using a compartmental model named SIR model.
This model comprises of three parameters- Suspicious, Infectious and Recovered. These parameters show the no of people who are suspicious, infected and recovered in particular country or in whole world.
